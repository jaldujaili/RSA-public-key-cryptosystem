A simple program that will create a public and private key which will be used to encrypt a user input message and back by decrypting message using the public key. Algorithms ideas came from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)#Key_generation)

## Usage

run-> python RSA.py. Once running, you can enter a message and you can see the encrypted message and the encrypted message being decrypted.
